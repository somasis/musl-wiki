# Alternatives

Resource list for alternative libraries and programs that are lightweight, not
bloated, efficient or have other useful design characteristics and may be
usable with musl.

# Alternative Libraries and Programs

- [pkgconf] - Drop in replacement for pkg-config with no circular dependencies.
  Does not require glib.
- [netbsd-curses] - Drop in replacement for ncurses and ncursesw, ported from
  netbsd. considerably smaller than ncurses.
- [slibtool] - Independent reimplementation of slibtool, aiming to maintain compatibility
  and removing features that are unneeded on modern systems.
- [cDetect] - C replacement for feature detection generally provided by utilities
  like GNU autotools.
- [freeglut] - Replacement for glut.
- [libutf] - UTF8 library (note that by using musl, UTF8 support is automatically
  enabled. no need to use any 3rd party library)
- [gettext-tiny] - gettext replacement. Provides an extra-compatible implementation
  of libintl for musl, or a no-op, along with several no-op gettext utilities, and
  a complete msgfmt implementation.
- [gettext-stub] - Provides a stub replacement for libintl.
- [libdrpc] - Port of RPC based on Android's libdrpc. Replaces parts of older
  glibc RPC functionality and/or libtirpc.
- [libsep] - Minimal RPC library to assist compartmentalization of small
  applications.
- [minised] - Faster but limited earlier version of sed. (note that busybox
  1.20.2's sed implementation is 100% POSIX compatible and feature-complete)
- [ignite] - init replacement, works with runit.
- [linenoise] - lightweight readline replacement.
- [libedit] - drop-in replacement for readline
  ([needs a handful of symlinks][libedit-symlinks]). about 30% less code.
  lacks some rare functions but is compatible with a number of readline users,
  like gdb.
- ~~[termbox] - alternative to ncurses for simple terminal apps. 16 colors only.
  very small, clean, well designed code.~~ only up to commit [66c3f91b]
- [tinyalsa] - alternative to alsalib (interfacing with kernel's ALSA API).
- [libnl-tiny] - drop-in replacement for netlink (libnl 1.2). may need some
  [compatibility CFLAGS].
- [uuterm] - slim terminal emulator written by musl's author.
- [udhcpc] - small DHCP client, part of Busybox. use these [two][udhcpc-two]
  [scripts][udhcpc-scripts] to operate it.
- [ndhc] - small DHCP client, focus on security.
- [mandoc] - alternative to massively bloated groff and accompanying manpage
  implementation.
- [moe] - A powerful and user-friendly console text editor (alternative to GNU
  Nano and Joe), but written in C++...
- [textadept] - Highly configurable and customizable text editor written in C (and
  Lua) and based on Scintilla editor widget. Terminal version works with ncurses
  or pdcurses. Also check out Scinterm, the ncurses based version of the
  Scintilla editor component.
- [slock] - minimalist alternative to xlock and xlockmore.
- [star] - Alternative to GNU tar.
- [uSTL] - replacement for the C++ STL (Standard Template Library).

## Scripting languages

- [Lua] is a full-fledged small embeddable as well as standalone language.
  Pretty popular, but some semantic choices may make conscious programmer
  cringe: accessing non-existent (mistyped) variable returns legitimate value,
  array indexes start from 1, etc.
- [Quasar m4] is a small GNU m4-compatible re-implementation derived from the FreeBSD m4.
- [Squirrel] is embeddable language with C-like syntax and minimal number of
  syntax/semantics idiosyncrasies. Uses reference counting. Core builds to
  ~250KB for i386. uses C++ though.
    - [General-Purpose Squirrel] - fork to make a standalone general-purpose
      language out of Squirrel core, without compromising on lightweightedness.
- [jim] embedded Tcl scripting engine in ANSI C. compiles to 100-200KB depending
  on feature set.
- [TinyJS] An extremely simple (~2000 line) JavaScript interpreter.

## Regular Expressions

Musl's regular expressions pattern matching routines are based on the [TRE]
library. The Musl version of the code contains at least two bug fixes that were
never fixed in the original code. For file pattern matching (fnmatch), musl uses
an implementation based on the "Sea of Stars" algorithm.

Comparing Perl regular expressions implementations to Regex implementations
shows pattern matching performance for various cases, but it can be like
comparing apples to oranges. Perl regular expression pattern matching is not
equivalent to a regular language which can be solved by a finite state automata.
Some regex extensions also may not be compliant with the definition of a formal
regular language.

- [Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast] One comparison between
  regex and Perl regular expressions.
- [Regex Benchmark] Compares various regular expression methods' performances.
- [PCRE performance] Comparison of PCRE JIT with other regular expression
  methods' performances. Older performance comparisons don't typically include
  PCRE JIT which has better performance than standard PCRE. They just use
  standard PCRE.

# General Suggestions/Recommendations

- [Stuff that rocks] Suckless.org recommendations on libraries they prefer.
- [Harmful software] More recommendations from suckless.org and plan 9 for
  libraries to avoid and what to replace them with.
- [Puppy Linux forum thread on Unbloated resources]
- [choosing an ssl library]
- [Busybox tiny utility recommendations]
- [Unbloated resources in C] \(beware of stb* from nothings.org since author is
  ignorant about invoking UB\)
- [embutils]
- [MinGW Useful links] I realize the page is for MinGW, but it has several
  cross-platform library recommendations including a large list of GUIs. It's
  easier to refer to that page than to try to maintain two sets of library lists
  (here and at the MinGW wiki) for certain categories.
