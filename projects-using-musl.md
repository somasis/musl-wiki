- [Exherbo] has an x86_64 musl stage.
- [Gentoo] has stages for most architectures (has [musl overlay] for packages without mainline support yet)
    - <https://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-stage3-amd64-musl/>
    - <https://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/x86/autobuilds/current-stage3-i686-musl/>
    - <https://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/arm/autobuilds/>
- [glaucus] - A simple and lightweight Linux® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
- [Iglunix] - An independent, self-hosting, Linux distribution with no GNU software
- [KISS Linux] - An independent Linux distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of
  "less is more".
- [Mere Linux]
    - Uses pacman for package management and s6 for process supervision
    - Contains instructions for bootstrapping LFS-style
- [morpheus] - suckless linux distro
- [oasis] - statically linked linux distribution based on musl and other lightweight components.
- [sabotage] - experimental Linux distribution based on busybox and musl.
    - About 700 packages including X11, LXDE, alsa, SDL, C++.
    - Supports i386, x86_64, arm, mips, powerpc
    - Uses lightweight replacements for netlink, pkg-config, and gettext
    - Optimized for build speed and small binary size
    - Per-package directories following stow/gobolinux spirit
- [Snowflake]
    - Includes only of a minimal set of packages that can be crosscompiled.
      (Kernel, toolchain, busybox, gawk, make and sed)
    - Uses pkgsrc for additional packages, so supports thousands of packages
    - Mainly a platform for testing usrview, a system for per-process views of
      /usr, for very fine-grained control of package management.
- [solyste] - statically linked linux distribution targetting embedded hardware and various
  architectures
- [Talos] - A modern Linux distribution for Kubernetes.
- [TAZ] - a Gentoo-based livecd/livedvd
- [Vanilla] - A radically different, new, simple, customizable Linux distribution based on musl,
  busybox using LLVM/Clang as toolchain.
- [Void Linux] provides official musl based images.
